MODULE 3 PROJECT


This Solidity program is a Module 3 Project program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language.

Description


This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this program is to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using REMIX . The contract has one modifier , one constructor amd two functions . In this , modifier is used for assuring that only contract owner can access the constructor and mint the tokens . The contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens. Constructor is used to mint the tokens by the contract owner and functions are used to burn and transfer tokens . This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
